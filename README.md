# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
# Project Overview
To research and analyze the miles per gallon and suspension coils data to provide stastical information to the manufacturing team at MechaCar.
# Resources
Data provided for the project included the miles per gallon .csv (MechaCar_mpg.csv) and the suspension coil .csv (Suspension_Coil.csv) and then we ran statictics and reported the findings using the following applications:

### .R (version 4.1.0)
### .RStudio (version 1.4.1717)
### .Personal Github account

# Analysis and Workflow
### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Six variables used - vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD and mpg)
  1.Use the library() function to load the dplyr package.  
  2.Import and read in the MechaCar_mpg.csv file as a dataframe.  
  3.Perform linear regression using the lm() function and pass in all six variables (i.e., columns), and add the dataframe you created to the data parameter.  
  4.Using the summary() function, determine the p-value and the r-squared value for the linear regression model.
